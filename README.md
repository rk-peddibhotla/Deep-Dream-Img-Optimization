# Deep-Dream

Deep Dream Image Optimization leverages Google's DeepDream algorithm to generate and enhance patterns in images, creating a dream-like, hallucinogenic effect. The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gradient-based optimization to amplify features in images.

## Features
* Image pattern enhancement through deep neural networks
* Recursive image optimization for high-resolution results
* Gradient-based image transformation using TensorFlow
